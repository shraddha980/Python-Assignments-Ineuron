    "Encoding is the process of representing data in a computer-readable form. There are many ways to encode data—ASCII, Latin-1, and more—and each encoding has its own strengths and weaknesses, but perhaps the most common is UTF-8. This is a type of encoding that allows characters from all over the world to be represented in a single character set. As such, UTF-8 is an essential tool for anyone working with internationalized data. In general, UTF-8 is a good choice for most purposes. It is relatively efficient and can be used with a variety of software. UTF-8 takes the Unicode code point and converts it to hexadecimal bytes that a computer can understand. In other words, Unicode is the mapping, and UTF-8 enables a computer to understand that mapping.\n",

It is also worth mentioning that the decode() function can only decode the byte string, which is specified by using the letter b at the beginning of the string. Removing the b would result in an AttributeError.\n",

    "Normalization helps determine whether two characters written in different fonts are the same, which is useful when two characters with different code points produce the same result. For example, the Unicode character R and ℜ are the same to the human eye, as they are both the letter R, but a computer considers them to be different characters.\n",

Unicode has four types of normalization forms you can use for this: NFD, NFC, NFKD, and NFKC.\n",
