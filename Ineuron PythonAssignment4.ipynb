    "Method overloading is a way where we add new functionality to an already defined function, and in that way, we overload the function. There are many other languages that support method overloading, and Python also supports method overloading. For example, the plus operator is an example of operator overloading where it can add integers as well as strings. Then the minus operator who can subtract integers, as well sets, lists also so, that’s how Python has overloading features in its operator and functions.\n",

    "1. Overloading User-Defined Functions\n",
    "User-defined function overloading can be achieved in python by setting a parameter or argument value as none. So if an argument is set as none, then the function reacts in one manner when a value is not passed for this argument and in a different way when a value is not passed for the same argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overloading Default or Pre-Defined Functions\n",
    "Overloading built-in functions involve defining the pre-defined function, which is expected to be overloaded in the python class as a special function. So when the pre-defined function is declared a special function in the Python class, the interpreter will use this special function as the declaration for the pre-defined call. The below example explains this process precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator Overloading in Python\n",
    "This involves an extended interpretation of an operator more than its original purpose. The most common example is the addition operator ‘+’, where it can be used for usual addition and also for joining two different strings.\n",

    "Increases code reusability.\n",
