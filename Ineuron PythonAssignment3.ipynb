    "Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces.\n",

This statement provides an expression and a variable name which will be used to label the value of the expression.The basic assignment statement does more than assign the result of a single expression to a single variable. The assignment satement also copes nicely with assigning multiple variables at one time. The left and right side must have the same number of elements. For example, the following script has several examples of multiple assignment.An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.\n",

When a target is part of a mutable object (an attribute reference, subscription or slicing), the mutable object must ultimately perform the assignment and decide about its validity, and may raise an exception if the assignment is unacceptable. The rules observed by various types and the exceptions raised are given with the definition of the object types (see section The standard type hierarchy).Assignment of an object to a target list, optionally enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, is recursively defined as follows.\n",
