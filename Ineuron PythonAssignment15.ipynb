    "Parallel Filesystem Cache For Compiled Bytecode Files\n",
    "There is a new PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX setting in python 3.8, it configures the implicit bytecode cache to use a separate parallel filesystem tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the cache is reported in sys.pycache_prefix and none indicates the default location in __pycache__ directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX is also available as -X pycache_prefix in Python 3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug Build Uses The Same ABI as Release Build\n",
    "With Python 3.8, the same ABI is used whether it is built in debug mode or in release mode. When Python used UNIX in debug mode, it is now possible to load the C extensions that are built in release mode and the extensions build using the stable ABI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Release build and Debug build have become ABI compatible with Python 3.8. On UNIX, C extensions no longer have to be linked to libpython except for android and Cygwin. We can load the C extensions easily using the shared library python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when the UNIX is built in debug mode, import also looks for C extensions compiled in release mode and stable ABI.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-Strings Support = For Self Documenting Expressions And Debugging\n",
    "Python 3.8 has added a = specifier for f- strings. Let us take an example to understand this.\n",
    "\n",
    "user = 'eric_idle'\n",
    "member_since = date(1975, 7, 31)\n",
    "f'{user=} {member_since=}'\n",
    "Output: \"user='eric_idle' member_since=datetime.date(1975, 7, 31)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual f-strings specifier allows more control over how the result is displayed, but the = specifier displays the whole expression so the calculations can be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Runtime Audit Hooks\n",
    "The new python release has added an audit hook and a verified open hook, they allow applications and frameworks written in pure Python code to take advantage of extra notifications. They also allow system administrators or embedders to deploy builds of python where auditing is always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "An audit hook in an application is an exit point that allows the auditor to add the modules subsequently. This happens by activating the hook to transfer control to an audit module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verified Open Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "The verified open hook allows python embedders to integrate with operating system support when launching scripts or importing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Initialization Configuration\n",
    "Python 3.8 adds new C API to configure the initialization for finer control and better error reporting. The following new structures are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyConfig\n",
    "PyPreConfig\n",
    "PyStatus\n",
    "PyWideStringLight\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorcall\n",
    "It is a fast calling protocol for CPython, It is added to the Python/C API. It is basically meant to formalize the existing optimizations that were already made for various classes. The vector call only deals with Python/C API and does not make any changes to the Python language and standard libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any extension type that implements a callable can use this protocol in Python 3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it has been added in the current release, it is still provisional and will be made fully public in the next release with Python 3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickle Protocol 5 With Out-Of-Band Data Buffers\n",
    "The process in which a Python object hierarchy is converted to byte stream is known as “pickling”. It is also known as serialization, marshalling, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pickle is used to transfer large data transfers between the python processes in order to take full advantage of multi-core or multi-machine processing, it is important to optimize the transfer by reducing memory copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pickle 5 protocol introduces support for out-of-band buffers where data can be transmitted separately from the main pickle stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "It covers the extra metadata needed for out-of-band data buffers\n",
    "Pickle 5 has a new PickleBuffer type for __reduce_ex__ implementations to return out-of-band data buffers\n",
    "It has a new buffer_callback parameter when pickling, to handle out-of-band data buffers\n",
    "It also has a new buffers parameter when unpickling to provide out-of-band data buffers.\n",
    "New Modules\n",
    "There has been an addition of a new module in Python 3.8, the new importlib.metadata module provides provisional support for reading metadata from third party packages. Let us take a look at an example in which it is used to extract an installed package’s version number, list of entry points, etc."
