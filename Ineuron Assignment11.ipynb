    "Metaclasses allow for code not only to manipulate data, but to manipulate classes. Often this change happens when an object of the class is instantiated. Using metaclasses also helps to abstract our code, making it more readable and helping to reduce the amount of code written by avoiding repetition in code.\n",

    "A metaclass might be created that prohibits classes that are instances of the metaclass from being created more than once. This is an example of the Singleton design pattern, which can be helpful for creating classes that connect to external sources, as it prevents more than one connection from being open at a time.\n",

Metaprogramming is the creation of classes that assist programmers when writing code by creating an infrastructure that the programmer can build on top of, rather than starting from scratch. Metaclasses provide these frameworks through their attributes, methods, and objects that the programmer can use.\n",

Hence, if classes are an object, they must be created by another class also called as Metaclass.So, a metaclass is just another class that creates class objects.

But we can also create our own metaclasses with custom behavior.To fully understand Metaclasses, one needs to thoroughly understand type().\n",
