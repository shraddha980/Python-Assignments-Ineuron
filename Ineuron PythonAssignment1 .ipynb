    "OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm used in many languages, including Python. In OOP, you can model real-world concepts using classes and objects. You can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This makes the code reusable, maintainable, and scalable. \n",

    "In Python, OOP is vital because it allows you to write more structured and efficient code. OOP in Python supports code reusability through inheritance. Using OOP in Python can make your development process more efficient and your code more readable.\n",

    "A class in Python is like a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines properties and methods that are common to all objects created from it. In Python, you use the class keyword to define a class. \n",
    "Classes help organize code by grouping related attributes and functions, promoting reusability and modularity. For instance, if you’re creating a program to manage a library, you might have classes for books, authors, and borrowers, each with its specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object in Python is an instance of a class. You can think of it as a specific realization of the blueprint provided by the class. An object contains data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. When you create an object, you are essentially creating a variable that has all the properties and behaviors defined in the class. \n",
    "For example, if you have a class for cars, an object could represent a specific car, such as a Honda Civic, with attributes like color and speed, and methods like start and stop."

    "Python is a popular scripting language. It also supports the object-oriented programming paradigm concepts. Object-Oriented Programming in Python involves object creation through Class, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. A class is like a blueprint that bundles different types of items under one roof. Python can have multiple classes in one Python script. Each class contains its own attributes, instances, and methods to maintain the state of the class. Python classes have the ability to protect the data from outside threats. Classes are accessed from an entity called objects. It has methods called member functions to modify the state of the class. Assume your class to be a house that contains house details like room, kitchen, doors, etc. Likewise, Class has different attributes called data members that tell us about the class.\n",

Think about vehicles, for example. Bikes, cars, buses and trucks are vehicles. Pick-ups, vans, sports cars, convertibles and estate cars are all cars and by being cars they are vehicles as well. We could implement a vehicle class in Python, which might have methods like accelerate and brake.
