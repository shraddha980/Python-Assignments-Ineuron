    "Often it is important to write programs that can handle certain types of errors or exceptions gracefully. More specifically, the error or exception must not cause a critical error that makes your program shut down. A Try-Except statement is a code block that allows your program to take alternative actions in case an error occurs.\n",

If any exception occurs, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if the exception type matches the exception named after the except keyword (ExceptionName), the code in the except statement will be executed (code block 2). If nothing in this block stops the program, it will continue to execute the rest of the code outside of the try-except code blocks. If the exception does not match the ExceptionName, it is passed on to outer try statements. If no other handler is found, then the execution stops with an error message.\n",

    "In Python, the with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file. A function or class that supports the with statement is known as a context manager. A context manager allows you to open and close resources right when you want to. For example, the open() function is a context manager. When you call the open() function using the with statement, the file closes automatically after you’ve processed the file.The with statement is a replacement for commonly used try/finally error-handling statements. A common example of using the with statement is opening a file. To open and write to a file in Python, you can use the with statement as follows:\n",

    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
